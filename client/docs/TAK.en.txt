Welcome to Tribes and Khans.
You will build a kingdom and fight your ennemies with your allies.
You start the game controling a city. Click on the bottom right button to enter your city.

You choose to dispatch the inhabitants within the different resources : use the sliders to select the number of workers on the wheat, the wood an the iron.
Resources are received every 10 minutes.
Use the population as well to build weapons in the forge, to build up armies and merchant caravans, and to grow up your city with buildings and upgrades.

In the Forge, use the sliders again to build bows, swords and armors.
The smiths in your city represent one percent of the total inhabitants.
Here, we got 1200 inhabitants, so we can build up 12 bows, which will consume 48 wood units and will take 20 minutes.

Here is the market : you can buy or sell resources and weapons, within the buy/sell tab.
Use the sliders to create your deal, and click the button to confirm it.
In this example, we buy 48 wood units and 28 iron units, which costs 299 gold units.

To create an army, use the sliders to select the number of warriors and then to equip this army with weapons and resources to carry on.
Here we choose 93 men equiped with 21 bows.
This is the same way for merchant caravans. Merchants move faster but don't use the weapons to fight.

Move your troops using the 'move' button, on the bottom right.
Then, draw the path for your unit by clicking on the board, cell by cell.
Your first land is your city.
When an army stays 1 hour on a cell next to your lands without moving, it conquers the land.
The more lands you have, the more gold your kingdom earns every 10 minutes.

That's it, you know the Tribes and Khans basics !
Build up your kingdoms with new cities, be part of an ally to get stronger against your ennemies !
